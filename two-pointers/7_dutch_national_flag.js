/*
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1

    Input: arr = [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
    Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
    Explanation:
        All 0s are moved to the front, 1s in the middle, and 2s at the end.
        The relative order within each group doesn't matter.

Example 2

    Input: arr= [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
    Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
    Explanation:
        All 0s come first, followed by the 1, and then all 2s at the end.
        Sorting is done in-place without using extra space or counting.
